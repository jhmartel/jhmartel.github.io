These objections will be elaborated below.\n\n\nGiven the critical nature of this series, we here respond to some potential objections. \n\n## 1.\nOne might object that all our arguments reduce to the observation that spheres in the frame $K$ are transformed to ellipsoids in $K'$ as is well-known. \n\nBut we remind the reader that Lorentz contraction is assumed to affect _material_ objects, even independantly of the nature of the material. So material spheres in $K$ become material ellipsoids in $K'$, where the eccentricity of the $K'$-ellipsoid is nontrivial and independant of the material nature of the sphere. However we respond that light spheres are _immaterial_ and not themselves subject to Lorentz contraction. And indeed if light spheres were subject to the same contraction effects as material spheres, then (A2) would definitely be false.\n\n## 2. \n\nCritics may object that (A12) only requires the consistent _measurement_ of $c$ in arbitrary reference frames $K, K'$. This would replace the law (A2) with some rule of thumb for measurements. \n\nBut this immediately leads to a well-known experimental difficulty at the core of special relativity, namely the impossibility of measuring the _one way_ speed of light. Indeed space and time measurements are always dependant on material objects and often non local, having sources and receivers separated by large distances. The impossibility of synchronizing non local clocks leads to the impossibility of measuring the one-way velocity of light. That all measurements of $c$ only succeed in measuring the _two way_ or \"round trip\" velocities of light where source and receiver coincide is discussed in [Zhang 1997] and [Perez 2011].  See also Veritasium's video \"Why the Speed of Light Can't be Measured\". \n\nMoreover in studying the two-way velocity of light, one needs further postulate that the velocity $c$ is constant (uniform) throughout its two-way journey, as Einstein argued. But this assumption is admittedly arbitrary and unverifiable. \n\n## 3. \n\nWolfgang Rindler's very interesting textbook attempts \"_in spite of its historical and heuristic importance_, [...] _to de-emphasize the logical role of the law of light propagation [(A2)] as a pillar of special relativity._\"\n\nRindler claims that \"_a second axiom [(A2)] is needed only[!] to determine the value of a constant $c$ of the dimensions of a velocity that occurs naturally in the theory. But this could come from any number of branches of physics_ -- _we need only think of the energy formula_ $E=mc^2$, _or de Broglie's velocity relation_ $u v =c^2$.\" \n\nRindler's objection is interesting, and our response is simply that the above quoted formulas are _equivalent_ to (A2), and not independant in any logical or physical sense.\n\n\nThe constant $c$ is central to modern physics. But what is the definition of this constant? Clearly Einstein defines $c$ as the speed of light (\"celeritas\", or swiftness) en vacuo. But is Einstein silently introducing a new definition of $c$ in his theory? What _is_ the origin of defining $c$ in vacuum?\n\nLet us review history. The constant $c$ was first formulated and estimated by Wilhelm Weber circa 1846, and even before J.C. Maxwell's famous treatise. Weber further studied $c$ with G. Kirchoff in the telegraphy equations. Here $c$ is the speed of propagation of electrical signals in long thin wires of arbitrarily small resistance. But the Weber-Kirchoff definition of $c$ is not equivalent to the $c$ of Einstein's special relativity. Einstein defines $c$ as speed in vacuum, and Weber-Kirchoff define $c$ as speed of signal propagation in a _material conductive wire_! \n\nThere does not appear any independant relation involving $c$ _en vacuo_ apart from Einstein's (A2). Even the incredible Weber-Kohlrausch formula expressing $c$ as ratio of electric and magnetic dielectric constants presumes a material medium, i.e. the ratio is _undefined_ in vacuum. Thus all _formulas_ involving $c$ (where $c$ is Einstein's speed of light in vacuum) are based essentially on some form of (A2), and the logical pillar remains unmoved. \n\n\n## 4. \n\nA fourth objection might criticize our argument for not properly accounting for the so-called wave-particle duality of light, e.g. Bohr complementarity.\n\nOur presentation has addressed both corpuscular and undulatory models, showing that (A12) is underdetermined in both cases. The incompatibility of (A12) with both the wave and particle model has been highlighted by A.K.T. Assis [Section 7.2.4, pp.133] from his \"Relational Mechanics\":\n\n- \"_we can only conclude that for Einstein the velocity of light is constant not only whatever the state of motion of the emitting body [source], but also whatever the state of motion of the receiving body (detector) and of the observer.\"_\n\nFor waves in physical medium, the velocity of emission is independant of the velocity of the source, since waves are transmitted _by_ the medium and their velocities a property _of_ the medium. Furthermore for both particles and waves, it is known that velocity is dependant on the velocity of the receiver. \n\nAccording to (A2), light is postulated to exhibit properties unlike both waves and particles.
