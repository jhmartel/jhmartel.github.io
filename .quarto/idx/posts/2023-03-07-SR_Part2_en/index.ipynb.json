Ultimately we argue that the Law of Propagation of Light (A2) is not Lorentz invariant, contrary to Einstein's claims. The error is subtle.\n\n\nIn the previous article (Part 1/4) we reviewed the basic assumptions of SR, represented in assumptions we call (A1) and (A2). \n\n\n- (A1) that the laws of physics are the same in all nonaccelerated reference frames, i.e. if $K'$ is a coordinate system moving uniformly (and devoid of rotation) with respect to a coordinate system $K$, then natural phenomena run their course with respect to $K'$ according to exactly the same laws as with respect to $K$. \n\n- (A2) that light in vacuum propagates along straight lines with constant velocity $c = 300,000 ~km/sec$.\n\nThe conjunction $(A12):=(A1) \\wedge (A2)$ leads to intellectual difficulties, as Einstein himself admits. But these difficulties are only _apparent incompatibilities_ according to Einstein which are resolved by postulating the Lorentz transformations. The assertion that Lorentz formulae resolve all apparent difficulties in (A12) follows from two claims:\n\n- Claim (i): that inertial frames $K, K'$ are related by Lorentz transformations. \n\n\n- Claim (ii): that the law of propagation of light (A2) is Lorentz invariant. I.e. if  (A2)  is satisfied in  $K$ , then  (A2)  is satisfied in every Lorentz translate  $Kâ€²=\\lambda.K$.\n\nThe key issue is verifying whether (A2) really follows from the Claims (i) and (ii). This is the subject of Einstein's spherical wave front argument which we examine below. \n\n\n\n# _Critique of Einstein's Proof of the Compatibility of (A12) with Lorentz Transformations_\n\nWe were led to reviewing Einstein's SR by reading the articles of S.J. Crothers and R. Bryant, which allege that Einstein's spherical wave proof contains significant errors. \n\nEinstein's argument looks to derive Claim (ii) as a mathematical consequence of Claim (i). The starting point is the fundamental property of Lorentz transformations, that the quadratic expression $$x^2+y^2+z^2 = c^2 t^2$$ is invariant with respect to Lorentz transforms. In other words, the null cone $N$ is Lorentz _covariant_. Thus if $$(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, \\tau)=\\lambda. (x,y,z,t)$$ for a Lorentz transform $\\lambda$, then we have \n\n- [Eq1] $$\\xi^2 + \\eta^2+\\zeta^2 = c^2 \\tau^2.$$  \n\nBut what does the expression [Eq1] represent?\n\nHere is Einstein's first error: his argument _misidentifies_ [Eq1] with \"the equation of a sphere.\" The error is subtle. But the fact is that [Eq1] is strictly speaking a three-dimensional cone in the four independant variables $\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, \\tau$. The cone indeed contains many spherical two-dimensional subsets, but our point is that _a second independant equation_ is necessary to specify these spheres. And these independant equations cannot be chosen Lorent invariantly!\n\nPenrose in his textbook with Rindler is quite careful here. The Penrose approach is to projectivize [Eq1] and obtain a _projective sphere_ with a uniquely defined Lorentz invariant conformal structure. \n\nBut again we must emphasize that there is no canonical metric invariant with respect to the Lorentz group on the projectivization. In otherwords, the null sphere has a Lorentz invariant conformal structure, but it does not have a Lorentz invariant Riemannian structure. \n\nFor instance the standard round sphere $S$ centred at the origin simultaneously satisfies [Eq1] and additionally the equation $$\\frac{1}{2}d(\\xi^2+\\eta^2+\\zeta^2)=\\xi d\\xi+\\eta d\\eta +\\zeta d\\zeta=0.$$ In short, the round sphere requires that _two_ quadratic forms $\\xi^2+\\eta^2+\\zeta^2$ and $c^2\\tau^2$ be _simultaneously constant_.\n\nThis leads us to Einstein's second error, which is the failure to observe that the Lorentz invariance of the quadratic form $h=x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2t^2$ in no way implies the Lorentz invariance of $h_1:=x^2+y^2+z^2$ and $h_2:=c^2 t^2$. \n\nIndeed the quadratic forms $h_1, h_2$ are degenerate, with nontrivial radicals $rad(h_1)=\\{x=y=z=0\\}$ and $rad(h_2)=\\{t=0\\}.$ The radicals are linear subspaces of ${\\bf{R}}^4$. But if $h_1, h_2$ are invariant, then $rad(h_1)$ and $rad(h_2)$ are also nontrivial invariant subspaces. This contradicts the fact that the standard linear representation of the Lorentz group acts irreducibly on ${\\bf{R}}^4$.\n\nTo summarize the two errors in Einstein's famous argument:\n\n- the cone $\\xi^2 + \\eta^2+\\zeta^2 = c^2 \\tau^2$ is misidentified as the equation of a sphere. \n\n- the Lorentz invariance of $\\xi^2 + \\eta^2+\\zeta^2 = c^2 \\tau^2$ does not imply the Lorentz invariance of the forms $\\xi^2 + \\eta^2+\\zeta^2$ and $c^2 \\tau^2$. \n\nIn otherwords, the numerical equality between $\\xi^2 + \\eta^2+\\zeta^2$ and $c^2\\tau^2$ is always maintained, but the actual values attained by the expressions is _not_ Lorentz invariant. \n\nWe are repeating ourselves because this is somewhat subtle point which is easily overlooked.\n\n# _Elementary Computations in_ ${\\bf{R}}^{1,1}$\n\nTo illustrate the above ideas, it's convenient to examine some elementary computations in two variables. Thus we consider ${\\bf{R}^2}$ with $(x,t)$ and $(\\xi, \\tau)$ coordinates. \n\nFor numerical convenience we set $c:=1$.\n\nThus $h=x^2-t^2$ is a quadratic form on ${\\bf{R}}^2$ invariant with respect to the one-dimensional Lorentz group $G=SO(1,1)_0$ generated by $$a_\\theta:=\\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh \\theta & \\sinh \\theta \\\\\n\\sinh \\theta & \\cosh \\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ for $\\theta\\in {\\bf{R}}$.\n\nIn two dimensions the null cone $$N=\\{x^2-t^2=0\\}$$ projectivizes to a $0$-dimensional sphere consisting of two projective points represented by the affine lines $x-t=0$ and $x+t=0$. \n\nThe round $0$-dimensional sphere $\\{x^2=1\\}$ consists of two vectors in the null cone, namely $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}, ~~~\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nLeft translating these vectors by $a_\\theta$ we find the translates $$\\begin{pmatrix} \\xi \\\\ \\tau \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh \\theta+\\sinh \\theta \\\\ \\cosh \\theta+\\sinh \\theta \\end{pmatrix}~~\\text{and} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cosh \\theta+\\sinh \\theta \\\\ \\cosh \\theta-\\sinh \\theta \\end{pmatrix}.$$ \n\nBut evidently $$\\xi^2 \\neq x^2=1^2=1$$ and $$\\tau^2 \\neq t^2=1$$ when $\\theta\\neq 0$. Thus the quadratic forms $h_1=x^2$ and $h_2=t^2$ _are not_ $a_\\theta$-invariant. Likewise we find the image of the unit sphere $x^2=1$ does not correspond to a spatial sphere in $(\\xi, \\tau)$ coordinates. \n\nThese trivial computations have the effect of falsifying the alleged Lorentz invariance of spherical lightwaves. However the \"slope\" of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ and $$a_\\theta.\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh \\theta+\\sinh \\theta \\\\ \\cosh \\theta+\\sinh \\theta \\end{pmatrix}$$ is identically equal to $c=1$ in accordance with (A2).\n\nTo further illustrate earlier comments on the nonexistence of canonical parameters on $N$, consider that for any $C^1$ monotonic function \n$$ f: {\\bf{R}} \\to {\\bf{R}} $$ we obtain a curve $$\\epsilon(t)=\\epsilon_f(t)=\\begin{pmatrix} f(t) \\\\ f(t)   \\end{pmatrix}=f(t) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$ for $t\\in {\\bf{R}}$. \n\nThen $\\epsilon_f(t)$ is supported on a straight line in $N$, and the \"photon\" $\\epsilon_f$ can be said _to propagate in a straight line with constant speed_ $c=1$. \n\nIt might be said that $\\epsilon_f$ is _not uniform_ in the parameter $t$, but we argue that there exists no _Lorentz invariant_ definition of \"uniform parameter\" on the null cone.\n\nThis is related to our discussion in Part 1 on Levi-Civita's attempt to derive a geodesic equation for light propagation, i.e. the hypothesis that light travels with zero acceleration. We reasoned that this is an arbitrary additional hypothesis, and not a consequence of the formal assumptions (A12).\n\nIn the remaining Parts 3/4 and 4/4 of this article, we consider the homogeneous wave equations and Lorentz transformations. As we have previously indicated, we find (A12) incompatible with _both_ the wave and particle models of light. \n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\nIn Part 2/4 of our critical review of SR we discuss the errors in Einstein's famous spherical wavefront proof.
