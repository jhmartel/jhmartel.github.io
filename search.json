    "text": "Assumptions of SR\nWe begin with Einstein’s introduction to his theory of Special Relativity (SR):\n“There is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows, or believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines with velocity \\(c=300,000 ~km/sec\\). Who would imagine that this simple law has plunged the conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual difficulties?”\nThe elaboration of these intellectual difficulties arising from this seemingly “simple law” is the subject of our discussion today.\nWhat are these difficulties? Namely to reconcile the following axiomatic assumptions of SR:\n\n(A1) that the laws of physics are the same in all nonaccelerated reference frames, i.e. if \\(K'\\) is a coordinate system moving uniformly (and devoid of rotation) with respect to a coordinate system \\(K\\), then natural phenomena run their course with respect to \\(K'\\) according to exactly the same laws as with respect to \\(K\\).\n(A2) that light in vacuum propagates along straight lines with constant velocity \\(c\\approx 300,000 ~km/sec\\).\n\n\n\nApparent Difficulties in (A12)\nThe difficulties arise from the conjunction (A1) and (A2), which we denote by (A12). \\[(A12):=(A1) \\wedge (A2).\\]\nIf Assumption (A2) is indeed a Law of nature, then according to (A1) this law of propagation should be invariant in every inertial reference frame. But (A12) appears contradictory to the principles of classical mechanics, e.g. Fizeau law of addition of velocities.\nEinstein alleges that these difficulties are only apparent incompatibilities, all of which are reconciled by postulating Lorentz-Fitzgerald formulae for length contractions and time dilations.\nThe assertion that the Lorentz formulae reconcile these difficulties contains two claims:\n\n\nthat inertial frames \\(K, K'\\) are related by Lorentz transformations.\n\n\nthat the law of propagation of light (A2) is Lorentz invariant. I.e. if \\((A2)\\) is satisfied in \\(K\\), then \\((A2)\\) is satisfied in every Lorentz translate \\(K'=\\lambda.K\\).\n\n\nWe critically examine these claims below. In what follows we will address both wave and particle models of light. Ultimately we argue that (A12) is incompatible with both models, i.e. incompatible with Bohr’s complementarity principle.\n\n\nLorentz Transformations\nThe linear algebra of Minkowski space and Lorentz transformations plays a definitive role in SR.\nLorentz transformations in the setting of SR can be defined as the group of linear transformations \\(\\lambda: {\\bf{R}}^{4} \\to {\\bf{R}}^4\\) which satisfy \\(\\lambda^*(h)=h\\) where \\(h=ds^2\\) is the Minkowski-Lorentz quadratic form \\[h:=ds^2=-c^2dt^2+dx^2+dy^2+dz^2.\\] Here \\(c\\) is the constant luminal velocity in vacuum posited by (A2).\nThe Lorentz invariance of \\(h\\) says \\[\\xi^2+\\eta^2+\\zeta^2-c^2 \\tau^2\\] is numerically equal to \\[x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2 t^2\\] for every Lorentz transform \\(\\lambda\\) satisfying \\[(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, \\tau)=\\lambda.(x,y,z,t).\\] Thus it is assumed that \\(h\\) is a scalar invariant for all inertial observers.\nThe group of Lorentz transformations was hypothesized as an attempt to explain the observed null result of Michelson-Morley’s interferometer experiment. The experiment was intended to measure variations of the speed of light relative to the aether. No such variations were discovered, and it was postulated that the usual space and time coordinates \\((x,y,z,t)\\) and \\((\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, \\tau)\\) of two inertial observers \\(K\\) and \\(K'\\), respectively, were not related by Galilean transformations, but related by the Lorentz-Fitzgerald formulae. Incredibly and contrary to all expectations, the material arm of the interferometer contracted in the direction of motion and simultaneously the time parameter was contracted by the same ratio, namely the so-called beta factor \\(\\beta = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\\).\n\n\nUniqueness of Lorentz Invariant Quadratic Forms\nIt’s interesting result of Elton and Arminjon [insert ref] that Minkowski’s form \\(h\\) is the only Lorentz invariant quadratic form on \\({\\bf{R}}^4\\) modulo homothety. This has useful consequence for the homogeneous wave equation, as we discuss below.\n\n\nMinkowski Space and Null Cone\nNow we say something about the photon model of light as treated in Levi-Civita’s book [III.XI.6, pp.301]. If light satisfies (A2), then in a reference frame \\(K\\), light is something \\[\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t))\\] that travels through space with time, and whose velocity \\(\\gamma'\\) if it could be materially measured as a function of \\(t\\) would satisfy - [Eq1] \\[||\\gamma'||^2=(dx/dt)^2+(dy/dt)^2+(dz/dt)^2=c^2.\\]\nThus it is argued that light trajectories are constrained to the null cone \\[N:=\\{h=0\\} \\subset {\\bf{R}}^4\\] of Minkowski’s metric \\(h\\). Obviously the null cone \\(N\\) is Lorentz invariant subspace, and defined by the equation \\[x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2\\] in any reference frame \\(K\\) with coordinates \\((x,y,z,t)\\).\n\n\nWhat does [Eq1] say about the Propagation of Light?\nAgain if light is something \\(\\gamma\\) that travels, then [Eq1] implies the speed of \\(\\gamma\\) is identically equal to \\(c\\) as measured in \\(K\\).\nBut the speed of \\(\\gamma\\) is independant of the direction of motion of \\(\\gamma\\) constrained to \\(N\\).\nEinstein’s assumption (A2) attempts to prescribe the velocity by assuming the propagation is along straight lines with constant speed. But again the velocity is still underdetermined, since the direction of the particle is not determined by it’s belonging to a straight line.\nWe are proposing that the direction and magnitude are not determined uniquely by (A2). Moreover the Lorentz transformations do not satisfy Claim (ii), i.e. (A2) is not Lorentz invariant.\nThe problem is that the schoolboy’s image of the propagation of light in vacuum is a Riemannian perspective. But this Riemannian perspective is not Lorentz invariant. Indeed in Riemannian geometry, if a particle is travelling in a straight line and with constant velocity, then the propagation of the particle, namely it’s position as a function of time, uniquely determined. However, in Lorentzian geometry, a particle which is travelling in a straight line along the null cone will always have a constant speed, regardless of its trajectory. Supposing that the trajectory is confined to a straight line, there still remains the question of the position of the particle as a function of time. The problem is that the of the straight line propagation is meaningless on the null cone of Lorentzian geometry.\n\n\nLevi-Civita’s Variational Equation is Trivial on the Null Cone\nHere we introduce Levi-Civita’s approach as represented in his excellent textbook. Levi-Civita modifies (A2) somewhat by asserting that “the propagation of light is rectilinear, uniform, and with velocity \\(c\\)“.\nThe term “uniform” does not feature in Einstein’s formulation of (A2), although it speaks to the hidden assumption that the light rays have a canonical parameter describing the motion of the light ray. The above remarks are directly related to Levi-Civita’s characterization of geometric optics in the following two equations (see [III.XI.16]):\n\n[Eq2] \\[\\delta \\int ds=0 \\] and\n[Eq3] \\[ds^2=0.\\]\n\nThe first equation [Eq2] says the variational derivative of the functional \\(\\gamma \\mapsto \\int_\\gamma ds\\) vanishes on the light trajectories, and the second equation [Eq3] says the trajectory is constrained to the null cone.\nIn the Riemannian setting where \\(ds\\) is positive definite, the equation [Eq2] is essentially equivalent to the geodesic equation \\(\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\gamma'=0\\).\nHowever in the Lorentzian setting we find [Eq2]reduces to \\(0=0\\) on the null cone \\(N\\). Thus the usual Riemannian \\(ds>0\\) argument does establish the corresponding “geodesic” equation on \\(N\\). This is acknowledged in Levi-Civita [III.XI.14], but Levi-Civita argues that zero length geodesics are limits of Riemannian geodesics (\\(ds>0\\)) and that “there is a process of passing to the limit (in conditions of complete analytical regularity) from ordinary geodesics”. Levi-Civita maintains that the variational equation [Eq2] somehow “implies” the geodesic-type equation \\(\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\gamma'=0\\) for light rays.\nOur viewpoint is that \\(\\nabla_{\\gamma'} \\gamma'=0\\) is an independant hypothesis, and by no means a formal consequence of [Eq2]. This is related to our contention that contrary to Levi-Civita’s claims, the variational equation [Eq2] on \\(N=\\{ds=0\\}\\) is trivial. In Riemannian geometric terms, we find straight lines on \\(N\\) have no canonical parameterizations, even affine. This reveals a clear distinction between Riemannian straight lines which do have a canonical arclength parameter \\(ds\\), and the null lines \\(\\ell \\subset N\\) which do not admit canonical \\(ds\\) arclength parameter except the trivial \\(ds=0\\)."

    "title": "Modified Fizeau Sansbury Spinning Wheel Experiment",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this post we discuss our modified Fizeau-Sansbury spinning sawtooth experiment. To begin we review Fizeau’s original 1849 experiment and introduce our modification which allows for testing R. Sansbury’s apparatus. While Fizeau studies a saw tooth wheel in uniform motion on the order of twenty rotations per second, Sansbury’s setup can be interpreted as either the same wheel in nonuniform motion, or a wheel with variable saw tooth length in uniform motion. We argue that Sansbury’s predictions could be tested if Fizeau’s wheel could increase it’s angular velocity from 20 revolutions per second, to 80 revolutions or 160 revolutions per second. This is not easily realized.\nAs described in previous posts, our critical essay on foundations in SR is basically stable and readable. Here we begin to elaborate on the concluding section, which briefly mentions Ralph Sansbury’s proposed experiment. Sansbury’s experiment is this. We take \\(c\\) the speed of light as equal to \\(1\\) foot per nanosecond \\([\\mu s]=10^{-8}\\) seconds.\n\nSansbury’s Experiment\nWe quote from Sansbury’s paper and his book “Faster than Light”.\n(Case 1) A \\(15\\) nanosecond light pulse from a laser was sent to a light detector, \\(30\\) feet away. When the light pulse was blocked at the photodiode during the time of emission, but unblocked at the expected time of arrival, \\(31.2\\) nanoseconds after the beginning of the time of emission, for \\(15\\) nanosecond duration, little light was received. (A little more than the \\(4mV\\) noise on the oscilloscope). This process was repeated thousands of times per second.\n(Case 2) When the light was unblocked at the photodiode during the time of emission (\\(15\\) nanoseconds) but blocked after the beginning of the time of emission, during the expected time of arrival for \\(15\\) nanoseconds, twice as much light was received (\\(8mV\\)). This process was repeated thousands of times per second.\nSansbury’s conclusion? That this indicated that light is not a moving wave or photon, but rather the cumulative effect of instantaneous forces at a distance. That is, undetectable oscillations of charge can occur in the atomic nuclei of the photodiode that spill over as detectable oscillations of electrons after a delay.\nSansbury found the equipment necessary for the experiment too expensive to rent for an extended period of time, and he was possibly not a sufficient expert in calibrating the equipment. So Sansbury’s experiment appears to have not been sufficiently investigated, and we would argue that the experiment has neither been reproduced nor properly reviewed. Thus we turn to the classical Fizeau experiment, and consider its similarities to Sansbury’s setup.\n\n\nFizeau’s Saw Tooth Experiment (1849)\nNow Sansbury’s apparatus has some similarity with Fizeau’s sawtooth apparatus, as used circa 1849 to prove some of the first sensible measurements of luminal velocity.\nHere is a blog which inlcudes a transcription of Fizeau’s original 1849 paper in Comptes Rendus.\nHere is an interesting youtube video en francais sur la mesure de Fizeau. Around the 4-5 minute mark is the most interesting. While the speed of the wheel is increased, the received light signal becomes increasingly erratic and intermittent, until a sufficiently high speed of rotation is achieved and the received light signal becomes eventually null and no light is received.\nHere is a useful physics stackexchange answer.\n\n\nSansbury vs. Fizeau\nNow Fizeau’s original setup is a type of Sansbury test where the wheel is in uniform motion. Sansbury’s setup involves either a wheel in nonuniform motion, or equivalently a wheel in uniform motion with a nonuniform sawtooth distribution.\nWe remark that Fizeau was historically looking to estimate the luminal velocity \\(c\\). Sansbury’s experiment assumes \\(c\\) as given, estimated at \\(1\\) foot per nanosecond. Sansbury’s goal is to distinguish light propagation from particle model, and his setup is meant to test whether light is even something that travels at all.\nLet’s review the basic math of Fizeau’s apparatus, it’s very simple. No matter how we setup the mirrors, we suppose light has some total travel time. In Fizeau’s original setup, light travelled a total path of \\(\\approx 16 km\\). With an expected speed of light \\(c=3\\times 10^8 km\\), then the expected travel time is\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{16 \\times 10^3 [m]}{3 \\times 10^8 [m]/[sec]}=5.333\\ldots \\times 10^{-5} [sec].\\end{equation}\\]\nNow consider the wheel with angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) having units of \\([degrees]/[sec]\\) and having a toothlength equal to \\(1/720\\) degrees. The time required to turn one toothlength is therefore \\(\\frac{1/720}{\\omega}=\\frac{1}{720 \\omega} [sec]\\). Thus we find that the expected travel time is equal to the time to rotate one toothlength if the following equality holds \\[\\frac{16 \\times 10^3 }{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{1}{720 \\omega}, \\] which implies \\[\\omega \\approx 26 ~~~\\frac{[rotations]}{[sec]}.\\]\nSansbury’s (Case 1) could be realized if the wheel was allowed to rotate nonuniformly, i.e. if the wheel could be accelerated in “impulses” something closer to the actual discrete motions of a clock. For example, if the wheel is initially opened at the time of emission, then immediately rotated one saw tooth length (to the closed position) during the expected time of travel, and just prior to the expected time of arrival is rotated another tooth length (to the open position), then Fizeau would predict that the receiver would observe a strong light source. However Sansbury predicts that the receiver would observe rather a very weak signal. Notice here we require the wheel to move twice as fast as Fizeau’s angular velocity. In otherwords the wheel must rotate two complete tooth lengths before the estimated arrival time.\nSansbury’s (Case 2) could be realized if the wheel was rotating nonuniformly. For example, if we keep the wheel fixed during the expected time of flight of the light particle, and turn the wheel one complete toothlength at the expected time of arrival, then Sansbury would predict a relatively strong signal would be received. Fizeau and the particle model would however predict no light would be received, since in the model it would be blocked by the sawtooth at the expected time of arrival.\nN.B. Fizeau’s conception of the sawtooth wheel is classical. But what happens if we retrospectively apply the SR methodology to the experiment, what results are obtained? It appears that SR has a null effect on the entire experiment, i.e. returns the same results as the classical case. While the sawteeth lengths are contracting in SR, this effects the circumference of the wheel but not the angular velocity. Thus Fizeau experiment appears insensitive to any Lorentz SR effects and an experiment which cannot prove SR in contrast to the classical mechanics.\nWe do not require mathematics at this stage, but rather to perform an experiment. However there is an intersting math aspect to the question, “How to keep a nonuniform wheel in uniform motion?”.\nFizeau’s original wheel was materially balanced: the distribution of teeth was equidistant and regular. The centre of mass corresponded with the axis of rotation.\nBut if we begin to study nonuniform wheels, then the behaviour becomes more difficult depending on, say, whether the centre of mass coincides with the axis of rotation.\nSome comparisons between Fizeau and Sansbury:\n\nFizeau’s involves several reflecting mirrors (beam splitters). Therefore there is more interaction involved in Fizeau’s setup than with Sansbury’s. For Fizeau’s is a type of two-way trip of light, where the source and receiver are space-coincident. But Sansbury’s is a one-way trip, requiring some electronics at the receiver namely a photodiode, to measure the amount of electrons released by the light emission.\nIf the phase of Fizeau’s wheel could be controlled, then we could compare the behaviour of the experiment when the wheels differ by one saw tooth length. The trouble in Fizeau is that, because the source and receiver coincide, it’s evident that no light is emitted when the phase is shifted one tooth length. Sansbury’s experiment however does emphatically require the apparatus to be open at the moment of emission.\n\n\n\nFaster Fizeau Wheels\nWe could test some of Sansbury’s ideas if we could increase the angular velocity of the Fizeau wheel by factor of \\(4\\), i.e. we need a wheel of roughly \\(100\\) revolutions per second instead of \\(20\\) revolutions per second.\nGiven such a revolution speed, then we could change the sawtooth pattern of the wheels, having some that are \\(1/4\\) closed, \\(1/2\\) closed, and \\(3/4\\) closed wheels. For example, we could have the alternating sawtooth \\[\\ldots 0101010101 \\ldots\\] or we could have \\[\\ldots 001100110011 \\ldots\\] both of which are \\(1/2\\) closed but having different patterns. And these patterns would have different predictions depending on the photon model or Sansbury’s cumulative action-at-a-distance. Likewise it would be interesting to compare the predictions given a wheel having a \\(1/4\\)-closed sawtooth pattern \\[\\ldots 0001000100010001 \\ldots\\] versus a \\(3/4\\)-closed pattern \\[ \\ldots 0111011101110111\\ldots.\\]\nIf we could get the Fizeau wheel to spin \\(200\\) revolutions per second, then we could test the theories according to \\(8\\)-periodic patterns, i.e. with sawtooth patterns being \\(1/8, 2/8\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(7/8\\)ths closed.\nIf we could build a larger wheel with more teeth, say, \\(1440\\) teeth, then \\(2880\\) teeth, then basic gear ratio would increase the speed of the initial pinion wheel by factor of \\(\\times 2\\), \\(\\times 4\\), etc..\nThe heuristics by which we can determine reasonable revolutions per second depends probably on some energy estimates and would require smaller and smaller radii.\n[To be continued…]"
